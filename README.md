# MoblieBankingApp
This project is a simple Java application developed for academic purposes to demonstrate the concept of Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It showcases how private data members, public accessors, and internal validation can be used to protect and manage sensitive data, using a BankAccount simulation as the real-world context.

The code is intended for educational presentations, classroom demonstrations, and to provide a beginner-level understanding of Java OOP principles. It is designed to be Eclipse-compatible and easy to run locally.

ðŸ”’ Focus: Encapsulation â€” data hiding, controlled access, and secure interaction with class members.
